### Hi there :wave:

I'm self-employed full stack web and software engineer from Indonesia :indonesia:.
In the past, I worked as a remote software engineer for companies in Europe, where most of my job was creating cross-platform desktop applications and libraries using Xojo programming language.
Currently, I'm working as a independent software consultant providing websites, services, and expertise for several companies.

Outside of programming, I'm also a Researcher and Physicist with Master's degree from [Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB)](https://itb.ac.id/) specializing in Physics of Complex System and Machine Learning.

I'm available to hire for remote and freelance jobs.
